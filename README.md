Fuzzy Controller for the Kessler game of Asteroids
Fuzzy Controller for Kessler Asteroids Game
Overview
Welcome to the Fuzzy Controller for the Kessler Asteroids Game project! In this repository, we aim to implement a fuzzy logic controller for playing the Kessler implementation of the classic asteroids game. The challenge is to design a controller that surpasses the performance of a basic test controller, which fires continuously without any movement.

# Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to create an intelligent fuzzy logic controller that not only survives but outlasts the test controller. The fuzzy controller should demonstrate improved decision-making, dynamic movement, and strategic firing to navigate the asteroids and avoid collisions while achieving a higher score.

# Getting Started
To run the project and observe the fuzzy controller in action, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
`git clone https://github.com/youssefelmarasy1/Kessler-Controller.git`
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
`cd Kessler-Controller`
Open the Kessler Asteroids Game environment with the provided test controller.

Run the fuzzy controller code (my_controller.py) alongside the test controller (test_controller.py).
